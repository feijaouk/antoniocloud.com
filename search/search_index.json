In highschool I followed the technologies path where I learned the fundamentals of Computer Science and Programing. Then, I the pursued a 5 years University degree in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering . I did learn a lot but was very difficult for me after second here. I had minor background in Electronics. Never give up! So, to improve my electronics skills, while studying at the University, I also enrolled in a 3 years part-time night course in \"Telecommunications and Networking Specialization\" . The private school was called \"Forino\", but since then has renamed to CINEL . It was here that I found my passion for Networking . I was a student at Cisco Network Academy for 1.5 years Cisco NetAcad . After passion my CCNA Routing and Switching Cisco Exam, I got a job offer at Unisys as a Security Consultant and Penetration tester . I was trained in many areas os security! Here, I found another passion, Security ! I learn best practices, tweaking and hardening configurations configurations, Windows, Linux and Networking. I learned so much I! I actually like to learn new things every day. As a Security Consultant, I worked with the largest organizations in Portugal in Finance, Banking. Luanda Angola \u00b6 After 1 year experience as a Security Consultant, I was assigned to a 3 years project in Africa, Angola, City of Luanda - Minister of Defence. Hand-on work, assembling racks and data centre equipment, and yes it had servers, cables, networking devices. This took about 1 months. My responsibility included: Year 1 Networking configurations following the best security practices Monitoring and Alerting Applications Connecting the various cities in Angola back to the Data-Centre in Luanda. (Some cities were connected through satellite trucks, it was great experience tweaking packets sizes, window-size and MTUs for latency improvements) Networking for standalone trucks connected through satellite Collaborating with other teams, mostly Develops, Microsoft Administrators and the Project Managers Year 2 Training the various local teams that would look after the Network Infrastructure Continuous improvements Collaborating with other teams Year 3 Continuous improvements Firmware upgrades Training the local Engineers I meet amazing people during my stay in Angola. London United Kingdom \u00b6 After this project, I went back to Portugal. I had learned so much in the past 5 years, but I wanted more. Most of the technical documentation was in English. In some occasions, I had to engage with the Cisco support. I had the feeling that sometimes I was struggling with the English language. (...) Fast forwarding, that is why I moved to England. Living in London, United Kingdom, working as Solutions Architect for AWS . I am a Solutions Architect at AWS , and on my daily job, I help customer with: with moving their workloads into AWS review complex Architecture and migrations project and , -->work with various customer and help them with any type of architectures and the best practices in cloud. I am am passionate with tech in generally and is a pleasure to me when I help others unfolding complex architectures. I built this page to practice and get experience.
