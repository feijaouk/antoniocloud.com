See this list of the smartest people ever on Earth, listed by their level of IQ! With links to Wikipedia to read more about these genius. Purpose of this list is to inspire others and myself. `Smartness` will be determined by IQ number. IQ does not really calculate intelligence. Someone who does badly at IQ tests can be brilliant at other things, like arts, playing music, dancing.

## Millenniums Problems

- Link [https://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems](https://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems)

If you think you are smart, if you solve `1 millennium problem`, you will get `1.000.000 $`(not by me, though!)

Currently, there are 7 problems

- P vs. NP Problem
- Riemann Hypothesis
- Yang-Mills and Mass Gap
- Navier-Stokes Equation
- Hodge Conjecture
- [Poincaré Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_conjecture)

- Born 13 June 1966, Leningrad, Soviet Union

[Grigori_Perelman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigori_Perelman) solved one of the problems, the [Poincaré Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_conjecture)

It took years for many mathematicians to understand his solutions

He was offered `1 million dollars` and fields medal for it but he said `no thanks`

He just went back to live with his mother in St Peterburg

## Additional notes

I hope you find this post inspirational.

Other areas to explore could be [STEAM_fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEAM_fields), which are defined `science`, and `technology`, interpreted through `engineering`, and the (liberal) `arts`, and based in `mathematics`.
