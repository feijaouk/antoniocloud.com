Learn Python with a simple "do it yourself" challenges. I went to bed thinking "how could I do the [Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) without looking on the internet. Next day, getting python skills into practice, I came up with the below basic python code:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/AntonioFeijaoUK/bd55d7129eb404720aa4e5b414f1cc5c.js"></script>

In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers form a sequence called the Fibonacci sequence. Each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.

Thought I would share this challenge in case there is someone out there looking to practice `Python 3` as weel. This is a simple and fun challenge. Try not to copy this code, create your own version, start simple, maybe just add numbers, then add the conditions `while loop`.

No matter how we present these numbers, it always seems to be impressive. Maybe that is why they are also known as the "gold ratio".


Learn more about the [Fibonacci numbers and sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) in this wikipedia page.

Let me know if this was useful.


Happy learning,

Antonio
