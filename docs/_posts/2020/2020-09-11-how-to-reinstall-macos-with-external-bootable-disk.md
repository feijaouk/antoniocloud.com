How to reinstall MacOS with external bootable disk installer for Mac operating system. **macOS Catalina, macOS Mojave, or macOS High Sierra**. You can use an external drive or secondary volume as a startup disk from which to install the Mac operating system.

This article was inspired after I helped a friend recover their Mac operating system and documents. Having an external drive with macOS really help and did a quick install. ![external-disk-with-various-macOS-versions](/assets/images/external-disk-with-various-macOS-versions.jpg "external-disk-with-various-macOS-versions")


After installing from an offline version, do run the Apple software update to get the latest updates and version. You can also run from the command line `sudo softwareupdate -ai`.


The purporse of this post is to share the links from [support.apple.com](https://support.apple.com/) for the instalations of the various Mac operating system versions.
